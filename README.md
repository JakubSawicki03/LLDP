# LLDP
This script is using LLDP to check the connection to the switch.

# HOW TO USE

Before running the script, set execution-policy to RemoteSigned or Bypass, then you can run the script :)

# Purpose of the script

I made this script to check which switch I am connected to. When there is a lot of switches you can quickly check the IP address and which exactly port you are connected to. Is is a way more faster than checking all switches in your company.
